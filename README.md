 A static content publishing tool for the modern web. It takes data in the form of JSON or YAML, and plugs it into Markdown and Liquid files, and spits out a website that can be hosted on your favorite server. WDHAN is for corporations, organizations, friends, peers, bloggers, hobbyists, and everyone under the sun.

## WDHAN will get you online
 WDHAN does *exactly* what it's told. It doesn't have any tricks to learn or exceptions to the rules. It just works.
 With WDHAN, there's no more digging through cluttered bits of reused HTML, or updating old databases with strange syntax.
 You can focus on the only thing that matters to you: being online.
